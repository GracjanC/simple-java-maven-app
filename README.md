# simple-java-maven-app

This project is a copy of the one linked in the tutorial I used for Jenkins configuration: https://jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-java-app-with-maven/

# From the base project:
The repository contains a simple Java application which outputs the string
"Hello world!" and is accompanied by a couple of unit tests to check that the
main application works as expected. The results of these tests are saved to a
JUnit XML report.

# Extensions:

Dockerfile is used to create a simple docker image with a couple of things installed. 
Jenkinsfile defines the job, which builds the java app, the docker image, and deploys it to the nexus repository.
